A simple console-based TicTacToe game written in Java.

---

## Project Description

This is a classic TicTacToe game for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players alternate turns placing their symbols (X or O). The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row ‚Äî horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

---

## Features

- Two-player game (X and O).
- Input validation for moves (checks for occupied cells and invalid coordinates).
- Win detection across rows, columns, and diagonals.
- Draw detection when the board is full with no winner.
- Simple console interface showing the game board.
- Object-oriented design with separation of concerns:
  - `GameField` class manages the game board.
  - `Game` class handles the game flow.
  - `GameLook` class handles displaying the board.
  - `Gamer` class represents players.

### Local (Console) Version

1. Compile all `.java` files.
2. Run the `Game` class.
3. Follow the prompts in the console to enter moves.

### Client-Server Version

1. Open three terminal windows.
2. In the first terminal, start the server:


```bash
mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=at.fhj.msd.server.Server"
```

3. In the second and third terminal, start the client:

```bash
mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=at.fhj.msd.client.Client"
```

4. Follow the prompts in the client console to play.

**Note:** Make sure the server is running before starting the client.
